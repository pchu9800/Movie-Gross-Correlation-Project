# 🎬 Movie Data Cleaning & Correlation Project (Python)

Welcome to the **Movie Data Cleaning & Correlation Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a complete **workflow for cleaning and preparing movie data** using **Python**. Built as a **portfolio project**, it emphasizes best practices in **data cleaning, transformation, and correlation analysis**.

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project focuses on preparing raw movie data for analysis:

- **Raw Data**  
  Movie data is imported from **CSV files** into **Pandas DataFrames**.  

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Handles missing values, converts numeric columns, and extracts release year from the `released` column.  

- **Correlation & Visualization**  
  Creates scatter plots, regression plots, and heatmaps to analyze the relationship between features like `budget`, `votes`, and `gross`.  

- **Insights**  
  Identifies which features have the highest correlation with gross earnings.

## 📖 Project Scope

The key components of this project include:

- **Data Loading** → Reading CSV files into Python using Pandas.  
- **Data Cleaning** → Handling missing values, converting data types, and extracting release year.  
- **Visualization** → Scatter plots, regression plots, and correlation heatmaps.  
- **Correlation Analysis** → Finding numeric features most strongly correlated with gross earnings.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

- **Python data cleaning and transformation with Pandas**  
- **Handling missing values and correcting data types**  
- **Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn**  
- **Correlation analysis to identify key predictors of gross earnings**  

## 🔑 Key Insights

- **Budget** and **votes** have the highest positive correlation with **gross earnings**.  
- **Production company** has little to no correlation with gross earnings.  
- Proper **data cleaning and numeric conversion** is essential for accurate correlation analysis.  
- Visualization using **scatter plots and regression lines** helps clearly identify trends and outliers.
